Problem Statement:

Visibility and Recognition: Many talented artists struggle to get noticed and recognized in a crowded and competitive art market.
Limited Reach and Accessibility: Traditional ways of showcasing art, like galleries and exhibitions, often have limited reach and accessibility, especially for new artists or those from underrepresented communities.
Challenges for Art Buyers: Art buyers often find it difficult to discover and access a diverse range of artwork that matches their tastes and budget.
Lack of Educational Resources: Aspiring artists and art enthusiasts may not have access to the educational resources, tutorials, and guidance needed to improve their skills and knowledge in art.
Cost and Accessibility of Traditional Art Education: Traditional art education programs can be expensive or inaccessible to people with limited resources or those living in remote areas, making it hard for them to pursue their passion for art.
